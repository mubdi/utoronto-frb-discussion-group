Welcome to the home of the University of Toronto Fast Radio Burst Discussion Group

We meet **biweekly on Mondays at 11 AM** in the **Astronomy Building** in the **Second Floor Lounge**. 

The goals of the group are:
* Comprehensively outline all the literature about Fast Radio Bursts
* To provide a forum to share knowledge about Fast Radio Bursts within the U of T Community
* Provide an opportunity for scientists of all stripes to ask questions about FRBs

We rely on volunteers to lead paper discussions, so please sign up for papers here: [Paper Discussion Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U_wEliQThPlyt-auFGRNrfsniYMJZJmxjuWhnvlx6UY/edit?usp=sharing)
